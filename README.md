Pyer's Forth
============

Here is my own Forth environment picked from PFE.
My goals are just to use rake, from Ruby, and have a Forth environment on my Ubuntu system and on my Beaglebone Black.

"rake" or "rake x86" command compiles pf for my x86 Ubuntu.
"rake arm" compiles pf for my ARM Beaglebone.
"rake help" gives you some help.

Do not use my 'pf', unless you know what you want.
Please visit the website for the project at http://pfe.sourceforge.net
