Pyer's Forth
============

Here is my own Forth environment picked from PFE.
./configure gives me sources for my Ubuntu x86_64.
My goals are just to use rake, from Ruby, and have a Forth environment on my Ubuntu system.

Do not use my 'pf', unless you know what you want.
Please visit the website for the project at http://pfe.sourceforge.net 

My target system is:
#40-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 23 20:30:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
