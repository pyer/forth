Use the usual gnu'ish sequence to make from sources...

> configure && make && make install

and there is "make dist" that uses the version number
from the pfe.spec file. Using "make rpm" will rebuild
everything and get you a set of rpm files. The toplevel
makefile requires that your "make" understands the -C
switch (i.e. goto directory and make there). The real
automake configure/Makefile.in are in the pfe/ subdir.

please read doc/tuning.* to optimize the performance,
by default pfe is built without gcc register forth-VM
on most platforms, and as a shared library. For 
BENCHMARKing, try to 
   "configure --with-regs=all --disable-shared"

> make check

The test-directory contains scripts that you can use to test,
however they don't check for correctness - just for the
differences to an expected result which is simply the result
of the run on a default system. To do your own comparisons, 
use `rm *.ou?` to get a clean state, and recurse into the
test/ directory to get a new series. Some checks in the
test/ directory are not autochecked with `make check` due
to problems in the signal/raise mechanics on some platforms,
especially the postpone test.

> make doc / make docs

and "dist-doc" - the reference docmentation is extracted
from comments in the sourcefiles. You need to install the
perl-based package from    =>   http://xm-tool.sourceforge.net 
to rebuild the 0.30.x documentation. (and 32.x docs).

The tarball contains the Forthprimer.pdf, a GNU FDL
tutorial for ANS Forth by Hans L. Bezeemer. It is shipped
along for your convenience, updates are made independently
at http://come.to/hansoft - the inital version of this
document was written by Hans Bezeemer, author of the
4th compiler.
