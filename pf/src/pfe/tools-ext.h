 *      The ANS Forth defines some "Programming Tools", words to
 *      inspect the stack (=>'.S'), memory (=>'DUMP'), 
 *      compiled code (=>'SEE') and what words
 *      are defined (=>'WORDS').
 *
 *      There are also word that provide some precompiler support 
 *      and explicit acces to the =>'CS-STACK'.

/** .S ( -- )
 *     print the stack content in vertical nice format.
 *     tries to show cell-stack and float-stack side-by-side,
 *
 *	 Depending on configuration,
 *	there are two parameter stacks: for integers and for
 *	floating point operations. If both stacks are empty, =>'.S'
 *	will display the message <code>&lt;stacks empty&gt;</code>.
 *
 *	If only the floating point stack is empty, =>'.S' displays
 *	the integer stack items  in one column, one item per line,
 *	both in hex and in decimal like this (the first item is topmost):
 12345 HEX 67890 .S
    	424080 [00067890]
         12345 [00003039] ok
 *
 *      If both stacks ar not empty, => .S displays both stacks, in two
 *	columns, one item per line
 HEX 123456.78E90 ok
 DECIMAL 123456.78E90 .S
    	   291 [00000123]          1.234568E+95
    1164414608 [45678E90] ok
 * 	Confusing example? Remember that floating point input only works
 * 	when the => BASE number is =>'DECIMAL'. The first number looks like
 * 	a floating point but it is a goodhex double integer too - the number
 * 	base is =>'HEX'. Thus it is accepted as a hex number. Second try 
 *      with a decimal base will input the floating point number.
 *
 *      If only the integer stack is empty, => .S shows two columns, but
 *      he first columns is called <tt>&lt;stack empty&gt;</tt>, and the
 *      second column is the floating point stack, topmost item first.
